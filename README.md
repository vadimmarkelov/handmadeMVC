Functions:

- The number of cities in the list can vary at any moment. 

- The list of cities should always be displayed in a three column layout, also in the case of, for 

instance, only four cities in total. 

- The list should be ordered alphabetically (as showed in the example above) 

- Clicking on each city name should display additional information about the city (some html) 

below the list.
